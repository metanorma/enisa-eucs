.Processes related to the issuance and maintenance of a certificate
image::figure2.png[]

The reference standard for these activities is ISO/IEC 17065 and in
particular, its Clause 7.10, where 'changes affecting a certificate'
are discussed.

=== Conditions for issuing a certificate

A CAB shall only issue a certificate when:

* the applicant has committed to all obligations that need to be fulfilled
under this scheme to obtain the certificate;

* the evaluation of the cloud service is successful and in line with
the evaluation requirements set in this scheme in <<annex_b>>, <<annex_c>>
for the requested assurance level; and

* the review of the evaluation results is successful and in line with
the requirements of ISO/IEC 17065 and with the requirements set in
this scheme in <<annex_b>> for the required assurance level.

The review shall be performed independently of the evaluation, and
it shall cover all reports provided during the evaluation to ensure
that the conclusions are consistent with the evidence adduced and
that the accepted evaluation criteria and evaluation methods have
been correctly applied.

The certificate shall be related to the version of the supplementary
cybersecurity information produced by the vendor as specified in Article
55 of the CSA.

The CAB shall establish a period of validity for the certificate that
shall not exceed the maximum period defined in <<sec_19>>.

=== Conditions for maintaining a certificate

During the validity period of the certificate, periodic reassessments
are required to ensure that the CSP continues to fulfil the requirements
set in this scheme. Such periodic reassessments shall not be separated
by more than one year. This period may be reduced by the CAB if there
are specific attention points that require an earlier reassessment.

Maintenance activities shall be initiated upon the following conditions:

* when the cloud service has been selected through the sampling rule
installed for the general monitoring of certified cloud service, as
defined by <<sec_11>> and <<annex_g>>;

* following a confirmed nonconformity with security requirements,
under the conditions defined in <<sec_13>>;

* following an identified non-compliance with the accreditation requirements
of the CAB, the CSA provisions, or the scheme requirements, that affects
the certification.

Maintenance activities may be initiated on the request of the owner
of the certificate upon one of the following conditions:

* a periodic reassessment is due to be performed;

* a renewal assessment is required to extend the validity period of
the certificate;

* a change of the certified cloud service requires an update of the
content of the certificate of the information published in compliance
to Article 55(1);

* a significant change occurs in the certified cloud service or in
the design and implementation of the security measures that fulfil
the requirements of this scheme.

Depending on the nature of the previous conditions, and in accordance
with the requirements established in <<sec_11>>, <<sec_13>> and <<sec_14>>,
the maintenance activities shall be triggered at the discretion of
the CSP, the CAB, or the NCCA. The National Accreditation Body may
also trigger maintenance activities where a complaint has been issued.

When the maintenance activities are initiated by the CSP, the request
to the CAB shall be accompanied with an Impact Analysis report (IAR),
in accordance with <<annex_g>>.

In all other cases when the maintenance activities are initiated by
any other party (CAB, NCCA, and any stakeholder acting as a sponsor
of the associated maintenance activities), the request shall be supported
by a maintenance rationale containing a description of the potential
or actual non-conformity or the identified non-compliance stated and
its potential impact on the certificate.

Based on the IAR or the maintenance rationale and on the requirements
defined in this scheme for re-assessment or renewal, the CAB shall
validate whether some evaluation tasks are deemed necessary before
its review and decision, and validate accordingly the scope of and
the workload associated to these tasks. The CAB shall also validate
the result of the necessary evaluation tasks once completed.

Typical conformity assessment activities are defined in <<annex_g>>:

* Periodic conformity assessment, including a partial re-assessment
of the cloud service, to be performed at regular intervals, during
the validity period of the certificate, as defined in <<sec_19>>.

* Renewal conformity assessment, including a full re-assessment of
the cloud service, to be performed before the expiration date of the
certificate.

* Restoration conformity assessment, following a request from a CSP
to consider changes in the certified cloud services, or following
a request from a CAB or from the NCCA related to a nonconformity (<<sec_13>>)
or to a new vulnerability (<<sec_14>>).

The CSP shall support footnote:[Where necessary, support shall imply
financial support to described activities.] the CAB for the conformity
assessment activities deemed necessary, unless otherwise specified
in <<sec_13>>.

Upon review and decision of the CAB, the maintenance activities shall
result in one the following decisions:

* continuing the certificate, corresponding to keeping the existing
certificate alive, without change;

* updating the certificate to reflect some changes in the certified
cloud service, including an extension of its scope;

* renewing the certificate with a new validity period and optionally
some updates, corresponding to re-issuing the same certificate with
a new validity period;

* withdrawing the certificate, and issuing a certificate with either
a reduced assurance level, or a reduced scope of the certificate to
still meet the current assurance level, potentially with a new validity
period;

* suspending the certificate pending remedial action by the CSP;

* withdrawing the certificate.

Decisions shall be accompanied with a Maintenance Report issued by
the CAB, in accordance with <<annex_g>>, and uniquely linked to the
certificate; it shall motivate the decision and, where applicable,
indicate any necessary change to the initial certificate.

In the case no maintenance has been requested for a certificate that
has reached its expiration date, in the case no maintenance has been
requested when a periodic assessment is due, or more generally in
the case a maintenance shall be initiated and no action was taken
by any of the responsible parties in due time the certificate shall
be suspended and the CSP notified of the non-compliance. If the CSP
does not perform the maintenance in due time (as defined in <<sec_13>>),
then the certificate shall be withdrawn.

All withdrawn certificates shall be subject to archiving. Archiving
shall consist of still providing access to the certificate and associated
information, with the clear indication of its withdrawal, for instance
that its expiration date has passed.

The following table shall be considered by the CAB to support the
appropriate decision on most frequent possible cases.

[[table4]]
.Nominal decisions associated with the maintenance of certificates
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| Cases | Nominal decisions

| The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and reviewed,
and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils the requirements
without significant changes in the service
| Continue the certificate until the next periodic assessment or until
its expiration date

| The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and reviewed,
and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils the requirements
and the changes impact the security of users without any reduction
in the scope of certification or assurance level
| Update the certificate with the new information and continue the
certificate until the next periodic assessment or until its expiration
date

| A renewal conformity assessment has been performed and reviewed,
and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils the requirements,
possibly with changes that impact the security of users without any
reduction in the scope of certification or assurance level
| Renew the certificate with a new expiration date and if required
with the new information

| The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and reviewed,
and have determined that the cloud service only fulfils the requirements
after reducing the scope of certification or reducing the assurance
level
| Withdraw the certificate and issue a new certificate with the reduced
scope or assurance level, possibly with a different expiration date

| The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and reviewed,
have determined that the cloud service does not fulfil the requirements
anymore, and action from the CSP is possible to maintain the certificate
at the same assurance level and scope, though not immediately,or improper
use of the certificate is not solved by suitable retractions and appropriate
corrective actions by the CSP.
| Suspend the certificate pending remedial action from the CSP

| The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and reviewed,
and have determined that the cloud service does not fulfil the requirements
anymore
| Withdraw the certificate

| The periodic assessment has not been performed in due time
| Suspend the certificate pending remedial action from the CSP

| Remediation action has not been performed in due time after suspension
| Withdraw the certificate

|===

A certificate shall only remain in the 'suspended' status for a maximum
duration of 3 months that may only be extended with the explicit and
motivated approval of the NCCA. In case no action is taken by the
vendor in due time the status of certificate shall be changed into
'withdrawn' by the CAB.

Any change of the status of a certificate shall be disclosed without
undue delay according to the requirements of <<sec_20>>.

=== RATIONALE

Requirements have been established considering the requirements associated
with ISO/IEC 17065, and ISO/IEC 17067, Conformity assessment - Fundamentals
of product certification and guidelines for product certification
schemes.

The full life cycle of a certificate, starting from its issuance with
a defined validity period till its due or potential expiration (by
validity period or preliminary to this due to a selection under the
sampling rules for the general monitoring of certificates, a potential
or actual non-conformity with security requirements, or an identified
non-compliance with the accreditation requirements of the CAB, the
EUCSA provisions, or the scheme requirements) has been considered.

One fundamental condition for issuing a certificate for the cloud
service is successful evaluation, based on the present scheme. Other
conditions stem from relevant provisions of the EUCSA, such as necessary
authorizations for CAB based on Article 60.3 of the EUCSA which are
external to the certification in its technical meaning, and may, if
not fulfilled after certification, be considered as non-conformance
cases.

All other certification activities are related to the phase after
the certificate is issued, where 'a change affecting certification'
occurs as mentioned in ISO/IEC 17065. These activities are described
as 'maintenance'. In that case, the CAB is obliged to act in response
to a given trigger.

Wording from ISO/IEC 17065 describing all relevant activities related
to the certificate which has been issued applies (see Clause 7.10).
