.Foreword for Reviewers
____
This annex has been recently separated from the main meta-approach,
in order to support the integration of the conformity assessment method
for level Basic with the meta-approach, so there may be a few remaining
inconsistencies in the text.

The current proposal is built on the following hypotheses:

* All CSPs are subject to the same requirements in order to get their
cloud services certified, regardless of the way in which their cloud
services are implemented (e.g., a SaaS provider implementing a full
stack vs. a SaaS provider relying on a subservice provider's infrastructure).

* The auditor is in charge of assessing the level of compliance and
assurance for subservice providers based on the information available,
including assurance reports of various origins and evidence provided
by the CSP in their risk assessment of their subservice providers.

Some important templates, described in annexes, are missing, as we
first need to determine to which extent they are to be considered
as requirements or as guidance.

=== INTRODUCTION

The content of this Annex complements the <<annex_b>> for conformity
assessments where the CSP claims compliance to the Substantial and
High assurance levels.

This Annex follows the content of the <<annex_b>>, and refines the
definition of the steps related to the audit by providing additional
detail.

[[sec_C.2]]
=== ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT

Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement
the CAB shall determine whether the application request is appropriate
by performing a review of the application.

The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application
to assess the applicability of the criteria as set in the EUCS scheme,
and to ensure that:

* the application request contains all the mandatory information;

* the information about the CSP and the service is sufficient for
conducting of the assessment and the certification process, and it
fulfils the requirements defined in the EUCS scheme;

* the CSP has acknowledged and understands its responsibilities as
set out in <<annex_f>>

* any known difference in understanding between the CAB and the CSP
is resolved, including agreement regarding standards or other normative
documents;

* the scope of certification is clearly defined;

* the resources, capabilities and competences are available to perform
the conformity assessment activities, including knowledge of the relevant
industry, an understanding of information technology and systems and
experience in evaluating risks as they relate to the suitable design
of controls, and experience in the design and execution of tests of
controls and the evaluation of the results.

The CAB may also express its opinion on the suitability of the assurance
level selected by the CSP.

In the case of a recertification, the CAB shall also ensure that:

* the reason for the recertification is clearly described; and

* where applicable, the CSP has provided an impact assessment of the
changes implemented since the last assessment.

Once all the review criteria are fulfilled and the CAB and CSP have
reached an agreement about the conditions of the engagement, the auditor
shall conduct the following major audit activities:

. Developing the audit plan (section <<sec_C.3>>);
. Execution of assessment procedures (section <<sec_C.4>>);
. Analysis of results (section <<sec_C.5>>);
. Issue of an assurance report (section <<sec_C.6>>) and of an evaluation
report (section <<sec_B.9>>).

Once the auditor has delivered the assurance report, the CAB shall
perform the following activities:

[start=5]
. Review of the evaluation (section <<sec_B.10>>);
. Certification decision (section <<sec_B.11>>); and
. Certification (section <<sec_B.12>>).

[[sec_C.3]]
=== DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN

[[sec_C.3.1]]
==== Introduction

The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in
an effective manner, including setting the scope, timing and direction
of the assessment, and determining the nature, timing and extent of
planned audit procedures that are required to be carried out in order
to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This activity
shall result in an audit plan as described in ISO 19011 and 17021,
and including the aspects presented in <<sec_C.3.2>> and <<sec_C.3.3>>
below.

For each activity mentioned below: the auditor shall document the
procedures executed, the information and documentation used, the evidence
gained, and the conclusion reached, as described in <<sec_C.3.3>>..

[[sec_C.3.2]]
==== Initial activities

In this phase the auditor shall:

* Obtain an Understanding of the CSP's cloud service offered and the
controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security
Requirements, by reading provided documentation and inquiries of people
involved.
** The auditor shall obtain and read the CSP's description of its
system, identify the boundaries of that system, and how it interfaces
with other systems (e.g. cloud services provided by subservice organizations)
and shall evaluate whether those aspects of the description are fairly
presented.

* Assess, if applicable, the mapping between the Security Objectives
and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS and the CSP's
control framework:
** To conclude whether the applicable Security Objectives and related
Security Requirements of the EUCS are covered by the CSP's internal
controls;
** To identify any remaining risks (as a result of gaps in the mapping)
and the possible impact of them;

* Determine to what extent and for which elements of the CSP's internal
controls sub service organisations are being used and how the CSP
controls and monitors the services provided by these sub service organisations;
** To determine which assessment approach is appropriate: using the
inclusive or carve-out method, or a suitable alternative.
** To identify which sub service organisations do have an acceptable
assurance report which can be (re)used.

* Assess how the CSP dealt with complementary controls towards customers
of the CSP (user entities) and towards sub service organisations,
as well complementary controls of sub service organisations towards
the CSP.

* Consider materiality, i.e. the relative importance and effect of
possible omissions or deviations with respect to the fair presentation
of the description, the suitability of the design of controls and
the operating effectiveness of controls, primarily based on qualitative
factors, for example: whether the description includes the significant
aspects of the cloud systems in accordance with the requirements as
defined by the EUCS; whether the description omits or distorts relevant
information;
** Determine to what extent, if any, to use the work of an internal
audit function from the CSP and/or to use specific experts;
** The use of an internal audit function is highly dependent of a
number of criteria
** The use of a specific expert is dependent of the nature of the
audit procedure and the complexity of the item to be examined.

* Determine audit procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate
objective evidence about the design, implementation and the operating
effectiveness of the CSP's internal controls to meet the Security
Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by
the EUCS. These procedures are described in the detailed audit plan
(<<sec_C.3.3>>).

* Determine the roles and responsibilities of the audit team members,
as well as guides and observers or interpreters;

* Determine the logistics and communications arrangements, including
specific arrangements for the locations to be audited (e.g. datacentre
visits);

* Determine matters related to confidentiality and information security
of records obtained during the audit;

* Determine any follow-up actions from a previous audit or other source(s)
e.g. lessons learned, project reviews.

In the case of a recertification, the auditor shall also:

* Analyse the impact assessment to determine the subset of audit activities
that need to be performed in order to cover the changes in the Cloud
service since the last assessment; and

* Analyse the reason for the recertification to determine the subset
of audit activities that need to be performed in order to satisfy
the specific requirements for that trigger (see <<annex_g>>).

[[sec_C.3.3]]
==== Detailed audit plan

Sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design, existence,
and operating effectiveness of the CSP's controls shall be gathered
using one or more of the following activities: inquiry, observation,
inspection, and re-performance of the control and re-performance of
programmed processing, as defined in <<sec_B.1.1>>.

Detailed reference audit procedures per Security Objectives and related
Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS shall be developed, using
general guidelines on how to perform some of the audit activities.
These references audit procedures shall be the basis for the establishment
of the audit plan, but they may need to be adapted to the specific
circumstances of the assessment, as explained below.

The CSP's actual approach to meet the Security Objectives and related
Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS will be different per
CSP. Although they will all have certain elements in common, the actual
design, implementation and operation of the controls to meet the security
requirements, will be different per organization.

As the actual design, implementation and operation of these controls
will be different per organizations, the risks that prevent the CSP
from meeting the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements
as defined by the EUCS will be different as well. The risks depend
e.g. on

* services provided by the CSP;

* components of the systems used to provide the services;

* environment in which the systems operate.

To deal with this situation, the auditor must be able to tailor the
audit procedures for the specific circumstances. By doing so, the
following aspects are typically to be considered:

* Whether there have been changes to the systems used to operate the
service or the organization (e.g. changes in processes, IT systems);

* The competence of the personnel who perform the measures or monitor
its performance and whether there have been changes in key personnel;

* History of errors in the operation of the measures (known from previous
examinations);

* The relevance and reliability of the evidence to be obtained;

* The nature of the measures (including their level of automation)
and the frequency with which it operates;

* The degree to which the measures rely on the effectiveness of other
measures.

The audit procedures need to be adapted to a specific security requirement
and desired level of certification. Security requirements have been
constructed in a way that all security requirements for level basic
are applicable to levels substantial and high, while security requirements
for level substantial also apply to level high. Therefore, it is necessary
to access all security requirements on the specific level, including
those from lower levels. Security requirements that were initially
written for level Basic, are also applicable to levels Substantial
and High, but they would be assessed in different ways according the
certification level.

[[fig5]]
.the Audit procedure
image::figure5.png[]

Based on the analysis above the auditor shall determine for each control
and security measure under audit:

* the nature (what kind of audit procedure),

* the extent (how many or how often to execute the procedure), and

* the timing (at what point in time or over what period)
of the evidence gathering audit procedures.

=== NATURE

The nature of an audit procedures relates to the kind of an audit
procedures and describes the way how to obtain the evidence required.

Selecting the nature depends on the specific characteristics of the
specific control or security measure under audit. The rigour and depth
increase from substantial to high assurance level. The different natures
of activities are described in <<sec_B.1.1>>.

=== EXTENT

The extent of an audit procedure relates to the number of observations
to be performed, the rigour and dept of inquiries, how many inspections
are needed, and the number of re-performances of a specific audit
procedure.

Determining the extent depends on the specific characteristics of
the control or security measure and the assurance level required.
The extent in case of the assurance level high is much higher than
for assurance level substantial. In many cases, especially for testing
operating effectiveness, a sampling approach is appropriate.

==== Sampling

The size of the samples to select in order to test the operating effectiveness
of controls primarily depends on the nature and frequency of the control.
The following sample sizes should provide reasonable assurance that
the tested controls operated effectively during the specified period
and that the associated control objectives were achieved during that
specified period. Where the population of occurrences falls between
the levels identified in the table below, the number of items to test
shall be interpolated, exercising professional judgment in determining
the appropriate sample size.

[[table5]]
.Determining sample size
[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
| Frequency of the control
| Assumed population of control occurrences
| Sample Size (per specified period)

| More than daily | Over 250  | 25 - 60
| Daily           | 250       | 20 - 40
| Weekly          | 52        | 5 - 15
| Monthly         | 12        | 2 - 5
| Quarterly       | 4         | 2
| Annually        | 1         | 1
|===

==== Timing

The timing of an audit procedure relates to the point in time of a
period to be covered of an audit procedure.

For obtaining evidence about design and implementation/existence the
audit procedures are built around a certain point in time: the reporting
date.

For obtaining evidence about operating effectiveness the audit procedure
need to cover a period before the reporting date (typically 12 months,
or 3-6 months for an initial audit), which is fixed in the scheme
and in <<annex_g>>, depending on the assessment type.

==== Documentation

The detailed plan shall be documented following the requirements defined
in <<annex_f>> for the "Audit Plan and Execution".

For each control or security measure under audit the template shall
be used covering the following topics:

* the control or security measure under audit;

* for the suitability of the design, the existence and implementation,
and operating effectiveness:
** nature of the audit procedure;
** timing of the audit procedure;
** extent of the audit procedure;

* the documents used, the names and function of the inquired people,
other information;

* the evidence obtained;

* the conclusion reached.

These procedures will vary between engagements and depends, among
other things, on the requested assurance level (Substantial or High)
and the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks
of material non-conformity of the matter being investigated. All the
three elements increase in scope, depth and rigour as the level of
assurance increases.

[[sec_C.3.4]]
==== Audit plan review

The auditor may request the reviewer (see <<sec_B.10>>) to provide
an opinion on the audit plan, to ensure that they agree on the structure
and content of the plan before its execution. The CSP may explicitly
request this review to be performed before starting the execution
of the audit plan.

[[sec_C.4]]
=== EXECUTION

[[sec_C.4.1]]
==== Suitability of the Design of Controls

A control is suitably designed, when actions or events that comprise
a risk (e.g. for information security) are prevented, or detected
and corrected. Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the
design of controls requires the auditor to determine whether

* The risks that threaten the achievement of the Security Control
Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS
have been identified by the CSP;

* The controls would, if operating effectively, provide reasonable
assurance that those risks would not prevent the Security Control
Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS from being
met.

To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall:

* obtain an understanding of the CSP's process for identifying and
evaluating the risks that threaten the achievement of the Security
Control Objectives and related Security Requirements and assessing
the completeness and accuracy of the CSP's identification of those
risks,

* evaluate the linkage of the controls with those risks, which is
typically a consideration of frequency or timing of the occurrence
or performance of the control (e.g. monthly, weekly, per triggering
action or event such as a service request);

* evaluate the party responsible for conducting the control (e.g.
competence and authority of the person, group or system);

* understand the specific activity being performed by the party to
determine especially how the control is triggered, how it is executed,
which tools or systems are used to support the execution and which
records are kept evidencing the execution; and

* validate the source of information (for example a log file, archive,
ticketing system, etc.) to which the control is applied to determine
whether this source is reliable and ensures for completeness and accuracy
of information processing.

Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls
typically requires the auditor to perform inquiries with the CSP's
subject matter experts and the examination of supporting documentation
that describe how the control should operate, e.g. written policies,
procedures or process flowcharts.

[[sec_C.4.2]]
==== Existence and Implementation of controls and security measures

In order to prevent, or detect and correct actions that comprise a
risk, the controls have to be placed in operation as designed.

After the auditor has concluded that a control is suitably designed,
is has to be concluded per control whether the control actually exists
and is implemented as designed.

To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall obtain evidence that
the controls and security measures have been implemented by examining
exemplary actions or events that triggered the occurrence or performance
of the controls (e.g. tickets) and to inspect the environment in which
it operates (e.g. suitable configuration of the tools or systems used
to execute the control in accordance with the design).

[[sec_C.4.3]]
==== Operating effectiveness

Controls considered to be suitable in design, shall be tested for
operating effectiveness over a certain period of time (specified period).
The auditor shall design the tests in a manner to cover a representative
number of actions and events that triggered the occurrence or performance
of the controls throughout the specified period.

For initial certification the period shall be at least 3 months for
level Substantial and 6 months for level High; for subsequent certification
the period is 12 months or the time since the operating effectiveness
was last tested in a previous conformity assessment. In all cases,
the period to consider shall be the period that precedes immediately
the conformity assessment.

In determining the nature, timing and extent of the tests the following
the auditor shall consider:

* the nature and frequency of the controls being tested,

* the types of available evidential matter,

* the nature of the Security Control Objectives and related Security
Requirements to be met;

* the assessed level of control risk,

* the expected efficiency and effectiveness of the tests, and

* the results of tests of the control environment.

A control is operating effectively, if

* it was consistently applied as designed throughout the specified
period, and

* in case of manual controls, they were applied by individuals who
have the appropriate competence and authority (e.g. changes being
only approved by personnel who are responsible for the service being
provided).

To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall perform procedures
such as inspection, observation, or re-performance in combination
with inquiry to obtain evidence about the following:

* how the control was applied;

* the consistency with which the control was applied; and

* by whom or by what means the control was applied.

An inquiry alone is NOT sufficient to determine whether a control
operated effectively. This also applies to controls, if applicable,
over the out-sourced processes to sub-service providers.

At level High, in addition to the testing for operating effectiveness,
the CAB and the CSP shall define procedures for the automated monitoring
of key security controls, including at least:

* A description of automated monitoring mechanisms implemented by
the CSP;

* A description of the procedures implemented by the CSP to handle
the deviations and nonconformities identified through automated monitoring;

* A description of the procedures used to notify the CAB, at least
when any major nonconformity is identified through automated evidence
gathering.

Specific controls and requirements are defined in <<annex_a>> that
define the general requirements for these procedures, and also define
the minimum et of automated evidence gathering mechanisms to be implemented
by the CSP.

[[sec_C.5]]
=== ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

[[sec_C.5.1]]
==== Evaluation of evidence obtained

The auditor shall evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness of
the evidence obtained from the executed audit procedures to conclude
about the suitability of the design, existence and implementation,
and operating effectiveness.

The evidence obtained shall be appropriate and sufficient to enable
the auditor to take informed decisions.

In addition, when using information produced (or provided) by the
CSP, the auditor shall evaluate whether this information is reliable
enough for executing the planned audit procedures by obtaining evidence
about the accuracy and completeness of such information and evaluating
whether the information was appropriately precise, detailed, consistent
and current.

Sufficiency is the measure of the quantity of evidence. The quantity
of evidence needed is affected by the risks of that the description
is not fairly presented and that the controls were not suitably designed
or operating and, if required, functioning effectively, and also by
the quality of such evidence (the higher the quality, the less may
be required). Obtaining more evidence, however, may not compensate
for its poor quality.

Appropriateness is the measure of the quality of evidence; that is,
its relevance and its reliability in providing support for the auditor's
opinion. The reliability of evidence is influenced by its source and
by its nature, and is dependent on the individual circumstances under
which it is obtained.

All relevant evidence shall be considered, regardless of whether it
appears to corroborate or to contradict the analysis of the description
or the controls against the applicable security requirements of the
EUCS.

If the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence
to conclude on a given requirement, then the audit shall be considered
inconclusive. This should be considered as a nonconformity, and handled
as defined in <<sec_B.6.1>>.

[[sec_C.5.2]]
==== Analysis of controls to meet the applicable Security Control
Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS

The analysis of the suitability of the design, existence and implementation,
and operating effectiveness of the CSP's internal controls, is based
on the requirements outlined in <<sec_C.4>> above.

For analysing whether the CSP's internal controls meet the Security
Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS,
the auditor has to consider whether the controls fully cover all aspects
of the Security Requirements. Several controls may be required in
combination per Security Requirement to fully meet each security requirement.

If the CSP already performs audits in accordance with other standards
(e.g. ISO 27001 or SOC 2), it is possible that the controls presented
in the description may be optimally aligned with the criteria of these
standards, but that their descriptions do not fully meet all aspects
of the Security Requirement of the EUCS to which they are mapped to.

The auditor's test procedures and the results thereof shall be documented
in the report according to the examples in the table below

[cols="4",options="header,unnumbered"]
|===
| Security Control Objectives
| <Service-Org>'s Description of Controls
| Tests Performed | Test Results

4+h| Objective: description

| *ID -- Security requirement*
| ID &#8211; Title of Control +
[Control Description]
| Test performed by the auditor
| Test result by the auditor

|===

In describing the tests of controls in the assurance report, the auditor
shall clearly state per control tested, whether the items tested represent
all or a selection of the items in the population. The auditor shall
further indicate the nature of the tests in sufficient detail to enable
the CAB's review team as the report recipient to review whether the
auditor has obtained sufficient and appropriate objective in accordance
with the requirements as outlined in <<sec_C.4>>.

If nonconformities (or deviations) have been identified, the auditor
shall record them against a specific control, including a description
of the objective evidence on which the nonconformity is based, the
extent of testing performed that led to identification of the nonconformities
(including the sample size where sampling has been used), and the
number and nature of the nonconformities noted. The auditor shall
report nonconformities even if, on the basis of tests performed, he
has concluded that the related Security Requirement of the EUCS were
met, and even if the CSP has implemented corrective actions to address
the nonconformities and the auditor has determined that the corrective
actions effectively address the nonconformities.

[[sec_C.6]]
=== ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT

After evaluating the result of the audit procedures the auditor shall
form a conclusion and issue an assurance report.

The conclusion shall include the audit team's recommendation as to
whether the cloud service should be certified or not. The conclusion
shall be based on the evidence obtained and the audit activities performed,
and express whether, in all material respects,

. For Substantial Level:
.. the CSP's description fairly presents its cloud service, including
the controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security
Requirements of the EUCS, and is free from material misstatements
as of a specified date (in case of an initial conformity assessment)
or throughout a specified period (in case of a subsequent conformity
assessment);
.. the controls stated in the CSP's description were suitably designed,
existed and were implemented to provide reasonable assurance that
the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements
of the EUCS were met as of a specified date (in case of an initial
conformity assessment) or throughout a specified period (in case of
a subsequent conformity assessment); and
.. the controls stated in the CSP's description operated effectively
to provide reasonable assurance that the Security Control Objectives
and related Security Requirements of the EUCS were met throughout
a specified period; or.

. For High Level:
+
--
[start=4]
.. (i) and (ii) above noted for Substantial Level; and
.. the controls stated in the CSP's description operated and functioned
effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the Security Control
Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS were met
throughout a specified period.
--

The auditor shall issue the assurance report using the template in
<<annex_f>>.

This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP.
