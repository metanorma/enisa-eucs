.Foreword for Reviewers
____
This Annex has been integrated recently, and it has not yet reviewed
by the TG5 thematic group.

This Annex is an adaptation of the Annex 12 of the EUCC scheme. Because
the topic is quite generic and covers the general organization of
peer assessment rather than detailed technical requirements, the content
has been only slightly modified.

Because the content has been adapted from EUCC, there may be leftover
references to products, Common Criteria, ITSEFs, and other terms that
normally don't belong to EUCS. Please flag such issues, and take note
that there is no willingness to use these terms here.

=== SCOPE

This annex describes the applicable procedure for peer assessments.
The procedure consists of four phases: preparation, site visit, reporting,
and adoption of a report.

The procedure only defines the process to be followed. In order to
be as comprehensive and objective as possible, checklists shall be
further developed in cooperation with the ECCG to assist the peer
assessment team. These checklists will contain a common understanding
of state of the art footnote:[As discussed in cooperation with the
ECCG and/or relevant subgroups.] and operating practices.

[[sec_H.2]]
=== OVERVIEW

The primary assessment team shall consist of two EUCS experts (Leader
and co-Leader) selected from two CABs issuing certificates at the
assurance level High of the EUCS.

This primary assessment team may be extended with additional EUCS
experts from other or the same CABs, and in the case of a delegation
of the issuance of certificates or of prior approval of certificates,
an expert from the concerned NCCA may be associated to the selected
CAB expert into the team.

.Assessment team organisation
image::figure6.png[]

Each EUCS expert in the assessment team shall have a minimum of two
years of experience as a certifier at a CAB issuing EUCS certificates
at assurance level High. In addition, at least one EUCS expert in
the assessment team shall have previously participated to the assessment
of competences of CABs issuing certificates at level High, as listed
in <<sec_7>>.

The peer assessment team may be assisted by subject matter experts.
Those experts may be certifiers themselves, but that is not essential.

It is also highly recommended that the peer assessment team members
have participated in previous peer assessments under the EUCS scheme,
either as observers or team members.

The peer assessment may be observed by observers proposed by other
NCCAs.

The peer assessed CAB may present to the ECCG any concern it has about
the choice of the peer assessment team members and observers, for
example in case of a conflict of interest
The peer assessment activities will be carried out in four phases.

The preparation phase will involve the review of the CAB documentation
by the members of the peer assessment team in order to become familiar
with the CAB's policies and procedures.

The site visit phase will consist of a two-week visit by the peer
assessment team to the CAB in order to assess the CAB's technical
competence, and where applicable of auditors performing evaluation
activities. The exact duration of site visit will depend on the possible
reuse of existing peer assessment evidence and results, and on the
number of auditors subcontracted by the CAB.

The peer assessment will include a reporting phase: the assessment
team will document their findings in a peer assessment report delivered
to the ECCG.

The peer assessment will conclude with the adoption of an opinion
by the ECCG of the outcome of the peer assessment.

[[sec_H.3]]
=== SCHEDULING PEER ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES

In accordance with the planning established by the ECCG, and taking
into consideration the possible priorities indicated in <<sec_22>>,
the ECCG shall notify the CAB of the peer assessment, and will task
a peer assessment team to perform the peer assessment.

The peer assessed CAB shall submit the required number of candidate
services for which the CAB has performed a conformity assessment,
for review by the peer assessment team. In general the candidate services
shall cover all technical aspects of the audit.

The required number of candidate services is:

* At least two (2) services; and

* At least one (1) service for every auditor accredited as subcontractor
for the CAB at assurance level High, if applicable.

The requested information and the list of candidate products (and
auditors) shall be provided by the peer assessed CAB to the peer assessment
team within one month after the notification by the ECCG.

The assessment team will arrange the dates for the peer assessed CAB
and where applicable auditor(s) site visit(s).

[[sec_H.4]]
=== RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PEER ASSESSED CB

The peer assessed CAB shall provide the following documentation:

* a full description of its scope, organization and operation, including:
** the title, address and principal point of contact;
** its role according to Article 56;
** the accreditation decision for the CAB;
** the procedures for certification;
** where applicable, the procedures for the prior approval for each
individual certificate or the requirements from a general delegation;
** the rules applying within the peer assessed CB and its internal
or external auditors to the protection of protected other sensitive
information;
** the titles and addresses of the auditors participating in the activities
and their status (commercial or governmental);
** the procedures by which the peer assessed CAB ensures that auditors
apply the evaluation criteria and methods correctly and consistently
and protect the confidentiality of sensitive information involved;

* the latest list of the certificates issues by the peer assessed
CAB for the last five years;

* two or more certificates and Certification Reports issued which
are selected by the peer assessment team;

* where reuse of the results of a previous peer assessment is proposed,
associated results, under the conditions of <<sec_22>>;

* the list of all auditors that perform evaluations for that domain
and a description of the evidence used when assessing the competences
of these auditors.

In addition, all relevant information about the quality management
system that has been implemented by the CAB in order to obtain accreditation
by its NAB shall be provided. It should be noted that this information
is provided for informative purposes and that the content of this
information is not the focus of the peer assessment. Any deviations
from processes described in these documents that are found shall however
be reported.

All written documentation and communications for the peer assessment
activities must be provided in English at least 4 weeks before the
audit date.

During the site visit, English will be spoken, unless the CAB and
the peer assessment team unanimously agree upon another language.

One part of the peer assessment activities during the site visit will
involve a review of at least one evaluation that has been completed
or is close to being completed within the CAB.

Although the conformity assessments for chosen services submitted
for consideration need not be entirely complete, there must be records
showing that significant evaluation analysis and certification activities
have been performed, and that the majority of the evaluation report
has been delivered to and reviewed by the certification team.

In addition to the selected services, the CAB may also provide the
peer assessment team with information on (up to) another two conformity
assessments which were completed in the 12 months prior to the start
of the peer assessment activities. If the peer assessment team has
sufficient time and resources, they will review these conformity assessments
during their site visit and, if they are found to be compliant with
the EUCS scheme requirements, will take them into consideration within
the peer assessment report.

The CAB is responsible for preparing, documenting and providing general
information on the candidate services. This information will be provided
to the peer assessment team for their review and selection and shall
include:

* a brief overview of the product,

* the status of the conformity assessment (if not completed, then
indicate what parts have been completed and what remains to be done),

* the target assurance level,

* any Security Profile compliance claims.

The peer assessment team will select at least one candidate evaluation(s)
to be assessed during the site visit(s) of the CAB and where applicable
of the auditor(s).

The CAB will identify a Point of Contact who will be the individual
responsible for facilitating the peer assessment activities and for
interacting with the assessment team leader.

The CAB Point of Contact is responsible for:

* Coordinating the site visit(s) dates and location(s) with the peer
assessment team,

* Delivering the CAB materials to the peer assessment team during
the Preparation Phase at least 4 weeks before the audit date,

* Coordinating any required auditor(s) visits with the peer assessment
team,

* Arranging all necessary approvals to allow the peer assessment team
to perform the CB and auditor(s) site visits and to have access to
all information required to complete the peer assessment activities,

* Coordinating the peer assessment agenda for the CAB, including scheduling
certifiers for peer assessment team interviews and briefings, ensuring
the availability of materials to be reviewed during the site visit,
etc.,

* Providing the peer assessment team with the ability to have copies
and printouts made for use during the site visit;

* Providing secure storage, if required, for the peer assessment team's
documents (e.g. lunchtime, overnight);

* Being generally available to answer questions and resolve issues
that may arise during the site visit,

* Coordinating the review of the peer assessment report by CAB representatives,

* Providing feedback to the peer assessment team leader on the peer
assessment draft report.

The CAB must have private room(s) available that is (are) large enough
to accommodate the peer assessment team and CAB personnel during the
site visit(s). Such room(s) will serve as the meeting room throughout
the site visit. Accessibility to records and CAB personnel will be
needed throughout the site visit in the meeting room.

[[sec_H.5]]
=== RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PEER ASSESSMENT TEAM LEADER

One member of the peer assessment team will be designated the team
leader. The team leader is responsible for the following tasks:

* Coordinating the receipt of materials from the CAB,

* Coordinating the decision regarding the selection of the candidate
services (and auditors) and notification to the peer assessed CAB,

* Drafting the site visit(s) agenda and coordinating it with the CB,

* Coordinating and completing the peer assessment draft report at
the end of the site visit,

* Delivering the peer assessment final report to the ECCG, and

* If necessary, monitoring the CAB's resolution of outstanding issues
resulting from the peer assessment.

[[sec_H.6]]
=== PREPARATION PHASE

The peer assessment team should begin preparation approximately four
weeks before the site visit. The peer assessed CAB shall provide the
peer assessment team with access to all written policies and operating
procedure documents four weeks before the site visit. Electronic and/or
hardcopy documentation have to be provided, depending on the preference
of the peer assessment team members and nature of documentation needed.
The peer assessment team should focus their review of the documentation
on gaining an understanding of the CAB's standard operating procedures.

The peer assessment team leader will coordinate the review of materials
during the preparation phase. If there is a large amount of material
to be reviewed, the team may divide it so that members review different
portions of the documentation. The team leader will also draft and
finalize the site visit(s) agenda, with input from the team members,
at the conclusion of the preparation phase. The site visit(s) agenda
must be forwarded to the peer assessed CAB no later than one week
before the site visit(s). It is recommended that the peer assessment
team leader should maintain close contact with the CAB Point of Contact
during the preparation phase to keep the CAB informed of areas that
will require further investigation during the site visit.

Previous peer assessment results with associated results may be proposed
by the CAB for consideration by the peer assessment team.

[[sec_H.7]]
=== SITE VISIT PHASE

[[sec_H.7.1]]
==== Determine that the constitution and procedures of the CB comply with the general requirements of the EUCC scheme

A checklist shall be used to determine if the processes that the CAB
uses to provide its conformity assessment services are sufficient
to ensure effective oversight of evaluations and to ensure that successful
certifications comply with the requirements of the EUCS scheme.

The CAB shall provide any relevant information associated to its accreditation
to support this determination.

Where the peer assessment team decides to check some procedures of
the CAB, this should occur before the assessment process commences.
Nevertheless, the peer assessment team should check that the CAB is
applying its procedures. This can be done at the site visit (see below)
for the particular conformity assessments being assessed.

[[sec_H.7.2]]
==== Perform the peer assessment

The peer assessment team should allocate two (2) full weeks for the
site visit(s). If the peer assessment is completed in a shorter period
of time, the team will not need to stay the full two weeks.

The peer assessment team shall have access to all evaluation and certification
documentation that was used by the CAB during its conformity assessment
process and especially when reviewing the evaluation documentation,
and shall be permitted to observe all activities carried out during
such review. If an evaluation team/certifier meeting occurs during
the site visit, the peer assessment team should observe the meeting.

The peer assessment team should not completely review the work of
the auditor, which may be covered by its own accreditation. However,
the peer assessment team should assess whether the deliverables available
to the CAB are of sufficient quality to allow the CAB to determine
that the evaluation was conducted in accordance with the appropriate
methodology.

The peer assessment team will make a determination of an auditor's
technical competence by:

* a visit of the auditor's site,

* interviews with audit team members on technical items related to
the assessment of EUCS requirements.

Findings corresponds either to

* nonconformities that are linked to a requirement from the applicable
checklist or to common understanding of state of the art and operative
practices that are not met (or not fulfilled). The latter will be
discussed with the ECCG and could, where appropriate, be incorporated
as a new item into the lists for use by future peer assessments.

* or observations that correspond to improvement proposals made by
the peer assessment team, not directly linked to requirements from
the checklist.

A non-conformity could be either critical or non-critical. A critical
non-conformity challenges the reliability of the results established
by the assessed CAB. The peer assessment team shall analyse and describe
the impact of each critical non-conformity.

At the end of the site visit, the peer assessment team should present
the list of findings (at least the draft list of non-conformities
associated to their criticality level) to the peer assessed CAB, so
that the assessed CAB can establish a proposed action plan to cover
the findings. The peer assessment team should provide the final list
of nonconformities (associated to their criticality level) not later
than 4 weeks after the site visit to the peer assessed CAB.

If non-conformities have been identified, the CAB may request the
support of the peer assessment team for establishing an action plan
associated to a timescale to implement the relevant measures.

[[sec_H.8]]
=== REPORTING

The peer assessment team shall produce a report that summarizes and
explains their findings.

The report should be agreed internally within the peer assessment
team. If the peer assessment team cannot agree internally, then majority
and minority opinions shall be included in the report.

The CAB's disagreement on findings can be incorporated to the report,
no later than one month after the report has been established.

The report shall also present the position of the peer assessment
team on the relevance of proposed action plan to cover the findings,
if this plan was submitted to the team prior to the delivery of the
report to the ECCG. If evidence that cover critical non conformity
is provided before issuance of the report, the team can reconsider
the criticality of the non-conformity and shall document this change
in the report.

The assessment team might include into its report relevant outcomes
and findings from other peer assessments reused.

Findings from the peer assessment team included in the report shall
be clearly identified, with a unique and unambiguous identifier.

The final report shall be produced within three months after the site
visit and will be reviewed by the peer assessed CAB prior to distribution
to the ECCG.

For preparation of the final report the following steps will be followed:

. the peer assessment team will prepare a draft report, including
all findings, unresolved minor and major non-conformities detected
during the peer assessment in the preparation phase and the site visit
phase, and deliver it for comments to the assessed CAB (one month);
. the assessed CAB will comment the draft report, highlighting any
points of disagreement and proposing changes to the report (one month);
. the peer assessment team will consider the comments received by
the CB and produce a final report with possible revisions (one month).

All three documents at points 1-3 will be delivered to the ECCG by
the peer assessment team to give evidence of the final reporting phase
of the peer assessment.

If any deviations of relevance for the NAB have been found, the NAB
shall be informed.

The report shall provide one of three possible verdicts:

Pass:: The CAB has met all requirements and no measure is required.

Pass with controlled (minor) nonconformities:: The CAB has not met
all requirements, but has provided a relevant actions plan and an
acceptable timescale for correcting the nonconformities identified
by the peer assessment team. There is no remaining critical nonconformity
identified in the report.

Fail:: The CAB has not met the requirements and has not provided a
relevant action plan and an acceptable timescale for correcting the
nonconformities identified by the peer assessment team

The peer assessment team leader (or a suitable representative with
full knowledge of the assessment) shall present the report to the
ECCG, including any disagreement within the team of with the peer
assessed CAB. He/she shall present the findings of the team and its
appreciation of how the measures proposed by the CAB will solve the
issues.

Where relevant, appropriate additions will be made to the assessment
checklist to assist future peer assessment teams.

[[sec_H.9]]
=== ADOPTION OF PEER ASSESSMENT REPORT

The following procedure is provided to guarantee adequate involvement
of the assessed CB to demonstrate prompt resolution of non-conformities.
The procedure also helps limiting the time for the adoption of the
peer assessment.

. The ECCG will request the ECCG subgroup dedicated to maintenance
of the EUCS scheme to prepare an opinion to be adopted by the ECCG
on the conducted peer assessment.

. The ECCG subgroup will meet to discuss the result of the peer assessment
(based on documents 1-3) and invite for the meeting the peer assessment
team and the assessed CAB. Following the meeting, one of the following
proposals of opinion will be issued by the ECCG subgroup:
+
--
* the final report from the assessment team is proposed to be adopted
as it is;

* an amended final report from the assessment team is proposed to
be adopted.

In the case of non-conformities, the opinion to be adopted by the
ECCG will include a recommendation to the assessed CAB to resolve
such non-conformities with an indication of the duration allocated
to this resolution. This duration should be limited to 2 months in
the general case and should not exceed 6 months.
--

. the ECCG subgroup will deliver to the ECCG:
+
--
* the minutes of the meeting;

* the proposed opinion to be adopted by the ECCG.

The ECCG subgroup shall ensure that any feedback on non-conformities
or recommendations received by the CAB that underwent the peer assessment
or the NAB will be forwarded along to the ECCG.
--

. The ECCG will provide its opinion on the draft opinion. In the case
of favourable opinion, the assessed CAB will:
+
--
* either pass the peer assessment (if the draft opinion indicated
a positive verdict of the peer assessment). The positive verdict will
be published on ENISA website directly with the accompanying peer
assessment findings.

* or be recommended to take the necessary actions to resolve the non-conformities in the allocated duration. The recommendation will not be published on the ENISA website.

The ECCG may also request the ECCG subgroup to re-examine the peer
assessment (starting at point 2. again), only one time.
--

. When corrective actions are requested by the ECCG to the CAB, following
the implementation of the corrective actions, the assessed CAB will
issue a report to the ECCG subgroup within 2 months

. The ECCG subgroup will hold a meeting within 2 months with the assessed
CAB and the assessment team to discuss the status of resolution of
the non-conformities. The lack of a report from the assessed CAB will
not prevent the ECCG subgroup to have the meeting.

. The ECCG subgroup will prepare an opinion to be adopted by the ECCG
containing either a pass (successful correction of non-conformities)
or a fail (residual non conformities already in place) and will deliver
the proposed opinion and the minutes of the meeting to the ECCG.

. The ECCG will establish its opinion based on the draft opinion and
adopt the final result (including residual recommendation, or no recommendation
for the CAB). The ECCG will adopt the proposed opinion or adopt its
own opinion, without recurring to further iterations with the ECCG
subgroup. The opinion adopted by the ECCG will be published with all
relevant documents on the ENISA website.
