.Foreword for Reviewers
____
The content related to assessment has recently been structured, and
in particular, the assessment for levels Substantial and High is now
split between two annexes. This organization is not necessarily permanent
and may be reconsidered.

The current proposal is built on the following hypotheses:

* All CSPs are subject to the same requirements in order to get their
cloud services certified, regardless of the way in which their cloud
services are implemented (e.g., a SaaS provider implementing a full
stack vs. a SaaS provider using a subservice provider's infrastructure
for the delivery of its own service).

* The auditor is in charge of assessing the level of compliance and
assurance for subservice providers based solely on the information
available, including assurance reports of various origins and evidence
provided by the CSP in their risk assessment of their subservice providers.

As we added more details, such as requirements for documents, these
aspects have been the subject of discussions until the last days before
the release of this draft candidate scheme.

[[sec_B.1]]
=== INTRODUCTION

[[sec_B.1.1]]
==== Definitions

===== Audit

In EUCS, the definition of an audit is taken from <<ISO17000>>:

* A systematic, independent, documented process for obtaining records,
statements of fact or other relevant information and assessing them
objectively to determine the extent to which specified requirements
are fulfilled.

ISAE/ISA proposes another definition for the term:

* A systematic process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence
regarding management assertions about conformity with the predefined
framework to ascertain the degree of correspondence between those
assertions and established criteria and [additional to ISO] communicating
the results to interested users.

For the purpose of this annex, we will consider that the definitions
are sufficiently close to be considered equivalent.

===== Reasonable assurance

A reasonable assurance engagement footnote:[An audit performed in
the context of the EUCS scheme is a kind of assurance engagement.]
is defined in <<ISAE3000>> as:

____
An assurance engagement in which the practitioner footnote:[Auditor]
reduces engagement risk to an acceptably low level in the circumstances
of the engagement as the basis for the practitioner's conclusion.
The practitioner's conclusion is expressed in a form that conveys
the practitioner's opinion on the outcome of the measurement or evaluation
of the underlying subject matter against criteria.
____

Reasonable assurance aims at reducing to an acceptably low level the
risk of reaching an inappropriate conclusion when the information
provided on the subject matter (here, the description of the cloud
service and the CSP's management claim) is materially misstated. Such
risk is never reduced to nil and therefore, there can never be absolute
assurance.

The conclusion in a reasonable assurance engagement is framed in a
positive sense: "Based on the procedures performed, in our opinion,
the cloud service XYZ satisfies the requirements of the EUCS at level
LLL."

===== Limited Assurance

A limited assurance engagement is defined in <<ISAE3000>> as:

____
An assurance engagement in which the practitioner reduces engagement
risk to a level that is acceptable in the circumstances of the engagement
but where that risk is greater than for a reasonable assurance engagement
as the basis for expressing a conclusion in a form that conveys whether,
based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, a matter(s)
has come to the practitioner's attention to cause the practitioner
to believe the subject matter information is materially misstated.
The nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in a limited
assurance engagement is limited compared with that necessary in a
reasonable assurance engagement but is planned to obtain a level of
assurance that is, in the practitioner's professional judgment, meaningful.
To be meaningful, the level of assurance obtained by the practitioner
is likely to enhance the intended users' confidence about the subject
matter information to a degree that is clearly more than inconsequential.
____

For a limited assurance engagement the auditor collects less evidence
than for a reasonable assurance engagement but sufficient for a negative
form of expression of the auditor's conclusion. The practitioner achieves
this ordinarily by performing different or fewer tests than those
required for reasonable assurance or using smaller sample sizes for
the tests performed.

In contrast with a reasonable assurance conclusion, the conclusion
in a limited assurance engagement is accordingly framed in a negative
sense: "Based on the procedures performed, nothing came to our attention
to indicate that the cloud service XYZ does not satisfy the requirements
of the EUCS at level Basic."

===== Determination activities

In the conformity assessment of a cloud service, the following determination
activities are essential.

===== Inquiry

Inquiry consists of seeking relevant information or representations
of knowledgeable persons. Inquiries range from formal written inquiries
to interviews and informal oral inquiries.

===== Observation

Observation consists of looking at a process or procedure being performed
by others, for example, the observation of the performance of control
activities. Observation provides evidence about the performance of
a process or procedure, but is limited to the point in time at which
the observation takes place, and by the fact that the act of being
observed may affect how the process or procedure is performed. Observation
is an appropriate way to obtain evidence if there is no documentation
of the operation of a control, like segregation of duties. Observation
is also useful for physical controls.

===== Inspection

Inspection is defined in <<ISO17000>> as the "examination of an object
of conformity assessment and determination of its conformity with
detailed requirements or, on the basis of professional judgement,
with general requirements".

In the context of EUCS, inspection involves examining records or documents,
whether internal or external, in paper form, electronic form, or on
other media, or a physical examination of evidence. Inspection of
records and documents provides evidence of varying degrees of reliability,
depending on their nature and source and, in the case of internal
records and documents, on the implementation of the controls over
their production. Inspection is often used to determine whether manual
controls are being performed. Evidence could include written explanations,
check marks, or other indications of follow-up recorded on documentation.

===== Re-performance of monitoring activities or manual controls

Obtaining documents used in the monitoring activity or manual control
activity and independently re-performing of the procedures. Comparing
any exception items identified with those identified by the responsible
control owner.

===== Re-performance of programmed processing

Input test data, manually calculated expected results, and compared
actual results of processing to expectations.

[[sec_B.1.2]]
==== Mapping requirements to controls

It is common practice in examinations that follow established assurance
standards and criteria catalogues, that CSPs map their internal controls
(the technical and organisational measures in place to prevent risks
or to detect and correct undesired events) to the requirements/criteria
of the standard. The information is typically presented in a statement
of applicability (e.g. for ISO 27001 in form a table that outlines
which of the controls in ISO 27001 Annex A are applicable and references
to further documentation about the applicable controls) or a description
about the service-related system of internal control (e.g. attestations
based on AICPA SOC 2). Mappings are typically presented per
requirement/criterion of the assurance standards with multiple internal
controls assigned to each requirement/criterion to demonstrate compliance.

In the EUCS scheme, the criteria are outlined in form of Security
Objectives and related Security Requirements in <<annex_a>>. They
represent the mandatory baseline per assurance level for which the
CSP must demonstrate compliance.

CSPs can map their internal controls per applicable Security Control
Objective and related Security Requirements. Re-using existing descriptions
can limit additional efforts for the CSP and contribute to the fast
adoption of the EUCSA. It also allows the CSP to demonstrate compliance
with multiple assurance standards and criteria catalogues during a
single examination ("test once, rely often"). However, this requires
the mapping to be complete, accurate and valid. Further, the nature,
timing and extent of evaluation procedures applied by the CAB must
provide the required level of evidence.

[[sec_B.1.3]]
==== Subservice providers

The cloud services offered to a CSC will in most cases rely on several
subservices, which may be provided internally at the CSP, externally
by a different CSP, or externally by a provider that does not provide
cloud services (e.g., a hosting provider).

In order to complete the conformity assessment of a Cloud service
by a CSP that uses subservice providers, it is relevant to identify
the subservice providers and apply the relevant procedures outlined
below.

==== ASSESSMENT METHODS

The assessment needs to consider all subservices listed in the description
of the service, internally or externally provided. Internal subservices
are necessarily in the scope of the assessment, but external subservices
can be handled using two different methods:

. Include the sub-service provider in the scope (inclusive method);
. Exclude the sub-service provider from the scope (carve out method).

Both methods are dealing with the services provided by a subservice
organization, whereby the CSP's description of its service presents
the nature of the services provided by a subservice organization.
In both cases, internal and external subservices are treated similarly
and considered as provided by subservice organizations.

===== Inclusive method

With the inclusive Method the subservice provider's controls to meet
the applicable Security Objectives and the related Security Requirements
are included in the CSP's description of its system. The subservice
providers are part of the scope of the CSP's conformity assessment.

===== Carve-out method

With the carve-out method the subservice organization's relevant control
objectives and related controls are excluded (carved-out) from the
CSP's description of its system. The subservice organizations are
not part of the scope of the CSP's conformity assessment. Instead,
the CSP's description presents those controls that are designed and
implemented to monitor the operating, and if applicable the functional,
effectiveness of the controls at the subservice organisation. The
monitoring activities shall meet the Security Objectives and the related
Security Requirements for "Procurement Management (Supply Chain Management)"
outlined in the scheme.

==== SUBSERVICES IN EUCS

In the context of the EUCS scheme, subservices assessed using the
inclusive method shall simply be considered as part of the scope of
the CSP's conformity assessment. The CSP shall be responsible for
ensuring that all required evidence is available about the subservice
organization, about the services it provides, and about these services
are integrated in its own systems in the provision of the cloud service
to be assessed.

Subservices assessed using the carve-out methods shall be considered
at all stages of the conformity assessment, and in particular during
the dependency analysis (see <<sec_B.8>>). During that phase, the
auditor shall review the assurance documentation available for the
subservice.

In the rest of this annex and in the following annexes, when subservices
are mentioned, the intended meaning is "subservices assessed using
the carve-out method", unless specified otherwise.

[[sec_B.1.4]]
==== Complementary controls

Information security of a cloud service can only be assured, when
the involved parties are aware of and follow their individual responsibilities.
For the designs of its internal controls the CSP assumes that user
entities (CSCs) and

subservice organizations operate complementary controls that work
in combination with the CSP's internal controls to achieve certain
objectives.

In the EUCS scheme, the CSP shall present the Complementary Customer
Controls (CCCs) and the Complementary Subservice Organization Controls
(CSOCs) assumed in the design of its internal controls as part of
the description of the cloud service.

If the CSP uses a subservice organization, the CSP shall obtain relevant
information about the CCCs that the subservice organization assumed
in the design of their internal controls. Relevant information can
be obtained from the subservice organization, e.g. in form of descriptions
of the cloud service in accordance with this scheme or other assurance
reports that require this information as well (e.g. ISAE 3402, AICPA
SOC 2 or BSI C5). For these CCCs the CSP has to ensure that appropriate
internal controls are in place. During a conformity assessment, the
CAB has to evaluate whether the controls related to the CCCs are suitably
designed, implemented and operating effectively.

[[sec_B.1.5]]
==== Presentation

The assessment of cloud services for all levels of the EUCS is based
on a meta-approach, which is described here. This meta-approach for
assessing and determining conformity describes the overall flow and
requirements of the conformity assessment of cloud services in the
context of the EUCS scheme.

The meta-approach is the same for all levels, except for the audit
itself:

* For the assurance levels Substantial and High, the Conformity Assessment
Body (CAB) shall use an audit approach based on either ISO standards
or ISAE standards, both complemented with the requirements as defined
in this meta approach, leading to providing reasonable assurance,
as defined in <<sec_B.1.1>>. This approach is described in <<annex_c>>.

* For the Basic level, as mentioned in the EU Cybersecurity Act, the
CAB shall use a simpler audit approach leading to limited assurance,
as defined in <<sec_B.1.1>>. This approach is described in <<annex_d>>.

The structure of this meta-approach starts with defining a clear objective,
followed by the development and execution of an audit plan, and ending
with the analysis of the gathered evidence and the delivery of an
assurance report.

[[fig3]]
.The structure of the Meta-Approach
image::figure3.png[]

The term "audit" is used for all conformity assessment activities
performed by the audit team and audit team leader (together called
"the auditor") of the CAB, including the analysis of obtained evidence
in an assurance report.

To be able to conclude whether all requirements of the EUCS are met,
considering the carve-outs and the use of sub service organization,
a separate analysis and evaluation needs to take place. This dependency
analysis, during which the audit team and audit team leader, or another
team designated by the CAB (nevertheless called "the auditor" for
simplification), analyses the assurance documentation available for
the CSP's subservice providers, and provides the results in the evaluation
report.

The audit report and the evaluation report together may form the basis
for awarding a certificate, after review by a team of the CAB independent
from the auditor, and together with the delivery of a certification
report.

Following <<ISO17065>>, the CAB who issues a certificate is required
to perform internally the review and decision activities. However,
other activities may be subcontracted, and in particular the audit.
Throughout this documentation, the auditor may therefore be part of
the CAB or of a subcontractor to the CAB.

[[sec_B.2]]
=== OBJECTIVE OF THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT

[[sec_B.2.1]]
==== Introduction

The overall objective of the conformity assessment is to determine
whether or not and to what extent a cloud service delivered by a CSP
is in conformity with the Security Control Objectives and related
Security Requirements defined in the EUCS.

To enable the CAB to perform the conformity assessment the CSP shall
prepare and submit an Application Document, including the description
of its service that outlines the underlying and supporting processes
and the accompanying CSP's statement about the conformity of their
cloud service with the requirements of the EUCS. The CSP shall use
the template as included in <<annex_f>> to the EUCS.

The object of the conformity assessment performed by the CAB shall
be the cloud service for which a description is provided, and the
objective of the conformity assessment is to assess how this cloud
service is built and operated with meeting the Security Control Objectives
and related Security Requirements as defined in the EUCS. This objective
shall be stated in a statement endorsed by the CSP's top management,
in a form that complies with the requirements defined in <<annex_f>>.

[[sec_B.2.2]]
==== Basic level

The objective is to provide limited assurance through the execution
of an audit (evaluation) by an independent auditor that the cloud
service is designed to meet the Security Control Objectives and related
Security Requirements as defined in the EUCS that are applicable to
assurance level Basic.

The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing
audit procedures as defined in <<sec_D.3>> and <<sec_D.4>> about:

* the information presented in the description as provided together
with or embedded in the application;

* the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Objectives
and related Security Requirements; and

* the existence and implementation of these controls as of a specified
date during the initial conformity assessment.

[[sec_B.2.3]]
==== Substantial Level

The objective is to provide reasonable assurance through the execution
of an audit (evaluation) by an independent auditor that the cloud
service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet
the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements
as defined in the EUCS for the assurance level Substantial.

The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing
audit procedures as defined in <<sec_C.3>> and <<sec_C.4>> about:

* the information presented in the description as provided together
with or embedded in the application (<<sec_C.3.1>>);

* the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Control
Objectives and related Security Requirements (<<sec_C.4.1>>);

* the existence and implementation of these controls as of a specified
date during the initial conformity assessment (<<sec_C.4.2>>); and

* the operating effectiveness (consistent application) of these controls
throughout a specified period in subsequent conformity assessments
(<<sec_C.4.3>>).

[[sec_B.2.4]]
==== High Level

The objective is to provide reasonable assurance through the execution
of an audit (evaluation) by an independent auditor that the cloud
service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet
the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements
as defined by the EUCS for the assurance level High.

The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing
audit procedures

As defined in <<sec_C.3>> and <<sec_C.4>> about:

* the information presented in the description as provided together
with or embedded in the application (<<sec_C.3.1>>);

* the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Control
Objectives and related Security Requirements (<<sec_C.4.1>>);

* the existence and the implementation of these controls as of a specified
date during the initial conformity assessment (<<sec_C.4.2>>); and

* the operating effectiveness (consistent application) of these controls
throughout a specified period in subsequent conformity assessments
(<<sec_C.4.3>>); and

[[sec_B.3]]
=== ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT

Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement
the CAB shall determine whether the application request is appropriate
by performing a review of the application.

The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application
to assess the applicability of the criteria as set in the EUCS, including
the decision whether the chosen assurance level is appropriate in
the circumstances.

Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in <<sec_D.2>>
and additional information specific to levels Substantial and High
are provided in <<sec_C.2>>.

[[sec_B.4]]
=== DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN

The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in
an effective manner, including setting the scope, timing and direction
of the assessment, and determining the nature, timing and extent of
planned audit procedures that are required to be carried out in order
to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This activity
shall result in an audit plan, and including aspects that are specific
to each assurance level.

In all cases, and for all levels, if the CAB has subcontracted the
audit, the CAB may at this point require a review of the audit plan,
which shall then be included in the contractual agreement between
the CAB and its subcontractor.

Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in <<sec_D.3>>
and additional information specific to levels Substantial and High
are provided in <<sec_C.3>>.

[[sec_B.5]]
=== EXECUTION

[[sec_B.5.1]]
==== Introduction

In the phase the auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate objective
evidence regarding:

* the suitability of the design of controls, including controls over
the processes out-sourced to subservice organizations (such as hosting,
infrastructure, platform, etc.) to meet the Security Control Objectives
and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS;

* the actual existence and implementation of controls to be in accordance
with their design as of a point in time (specified date); and

* for the Substantial and High assurance levels, the operating effectiveness
of the implemented controls throughout a period over time (specified
period);

Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in <<sec_D.4>>
and additional information specific to levels Substantial and High
are provided in <<sec_C.4>>. The auditor shall document the procedures
executed, the evidence gained and conclusions reached using the appropriate
document (depending on the assurance level).

[[fig4]]
.The structure of the Meta-approach
image::figure4.png[]

[[sec_B.6]]
=== ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

Once the auditor has gathered all required evidence, the auditor shall
evaluate its sufficiency and appropriateness. This part of the process
is specific to every assurance level, with the exception of nonconformity
handling, which is common to all three assurance levels and is described
below.

Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in <<sec_D.5>>
and additional information specific to levels Substantial and High
are provided in <<sec_C.5>>.

[[sec_B.6.1]]
==== Nonconformity handling

If the audit procedures reveal nonconformities (or deviations) in
the design, operation or, if required, functionality of the controls,
the auditor has to determine whether the applicable Security Requirements
of the EUCS were still met. The auditor should consider the following
procedures for the determination:

* Notification of the CSP if the nonconformity has been identified
by the auditor;

* Inquiry regarding their assessment of the cause of the identified
nonconformity;

* Assessment of the CSP's handling of the identified nonconformity;

* Assessment whether comparable nonconformities have been identified
by the CSP's monitoring processes and what measures have been taken
as a result; and

* Qualification of the deviation as minor or major;

These procedures are linked to each other, because the requirements
for the handling of an identified nonconformity depend on the qualification
of the nonconformity as minor or major. A major nonconformity is defined
in <<ISO17021>> as a "nonconformity that affects the capability of
the management system to achieve the intended results", with a note
stating that nonconformities could be qualified as major in the following
circumstances:

* there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in
place, or that products or services will meet specified requirements;

* a number of minor nonconformities associated with the same requirement
or issue could demonstrate a systemic failure and thus constitute
a major nonconformity.

In their analysis of nonconformities, CABs should consider both the
requirement that is not being fulfilled and the objective to which
it refers, to gain an understanding of the impact of the nonconformity
to the achievement of the objective.

For a minor nonconformity, the auditor needs to determine that:

* The CSP has determined the cause of the nonconformity;

* The CSP has defined a list of compensating controls that are in
place to address the risks arising from the deviation a list of corrective
actions to be performed in order to address the nonconformity and
a timeline to implement the corrective actions;

* The compensating controls already in place and the corrective actions
proposed by the CSP are sufficient to determine that the security
requirement is met with the expected level of assurance.

The analysis of compensating controls may include the assessment of
alternative organisational and technical measures of the CSP to meet
the Security Requirement of the EUCS, which have not been considered
in the design of this Security Requirement (e.g. use of new technical
measures that provide at least an equal level of security but that
are not prescribed in the Security Requirements of the EUCS). Compensating
controls are also considered a temporary measure, and nonconformities,
even minor, are expected to be corrected in the following conformity
assessments. The auditor may therefore define a list of conformity
assessment activities to be performed in subsequent conformity assessments.

For a major nonconformity, the auditor needs to determine that:

* The CSP has determined the cause of the nonconformity;

* The CSP has defined and implemented a list of corrective actions
to address the nonconformity.

* The corrective actions implemented by the CSP have adequately addressed
the nonconformity.

Compensating actions are not allowed for major nonconformities, for
which corrective actions shall be defined and implemented in order
to obtain or maintain a certificate. Nevertheless, if the corrective
actions implemented are sufficient to modify the qualification of
the nonconformity as a minor nonconformity, then the remaining nonconformity
can be handled as a minor nonconformity, possibly with compensating
controls.

The definition of minor and major nonconformities as well as the requirements
related to their handling will be refined in guidance provided by
ENISA with the support of the ECCG.

Regardless of the qualification of the nonconformities as minor or
major, the following information about the CSP's measures to handle
such nonconformities and optimise its internal controls shall be disclosed
in the assurance report:

* If the nonconformity was detected by the CSP itself, when and in
the course of which measures the nonconformity was detected.

* If the nonconformity was already stated in an assurance report of
a previous audit, an indication should be given of when and by what
means the nonconformity was detected, together with a separate indication
that the detection occurred in a previous audit period.

* The measures to be taken to remedy the nonconformity in the future
and when these measures are likely to be completed or effectively
implemented.

[[sec_B.7]]
=== ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT

After evaluating the result of the audit procedures the auditor shall
form a conclusion and issue an assurance report that satisfies the
requirements defined in <<annex_f>> for the targeted assurance level.
Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in <<sec_D.6>>
and additional information specific to levels Substantial and High
are provided in <<sec_C.6>>

The conclusion shall include the audit team's recommendation as to
whether the cloud service satisfies the requirements of the EUCS scheme,
pending the results of the dependency analysis. The conclusion shall
be based on the evidence obtained and the audit activities performed.

This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP. The CSP
may contest the content of the assurance report and in particular
the audit team's recommendation. If the dispute remains unresolved,
the CSP may file a complaint with the NCCA to request their opinion
on the matter of the dispute.

[[sec_B.8]]
=== PERFORMING THE DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

[[sec_B.8.1]]
==== Objectives

The objective of the dependency analysis is to validate that the assurance
documentation (assurance reports, certificates) available for the
subservices operated by internal or external subservice organisations
used by the CSP in the operation of its cloud service are adequate.

For every subservice organisation, the basis for this dependency analysis
is the risk assessment of the provider that has been performed by
the CSP. As required by EUCS (see <<annex_a>>), the assurance report
shall contain a rationale explaining how the CSP uses the subservice
to satisfy the scheme requirements, and for each subservice a pointer
to an assurance component for the subservice.

The dependency analysis consists in analysing these assurance components
to determine whether or not the subservice meet the expectations from
the CSP at the targeted assurance level.

[[sec_B.8.2]]
==== Assessing the availability of assurance documentation

The first step is to list the assurance documentation available for
every subservice provider, and to assess the overall relevance of
each assurance component for the dependency review.

The following elements are essential.

About the assurance component itself:

* Type of assurance component, with all required details (e.g., ISO27001
certificate, Type 1 or Type 2 for an ISAE report);

* Period covered or period of validity, possibly complemented with
bridge letters or similar statements;

* Applicable framework (existing standard or private framework);

* Inclusion of a mapping to EUCS in the assurance component;

About the auditor's professional competence and independence:

* Name of the CAB or audit organization, name of the audit lead.

* Evidence of the CAB/audit organization's and the auditor's competence
(accreditation, personal certification, etc.).

* Evidence of the CAB/audit organization's and the auditor's independence
(accreditation, etc.).

By analysing this information, the auditor shall determine whether
the assurance documentation available for a given subservice provider
is adequate to provide assurance corresponding to the targeted EUCS
assurance level.

ENISA, with the support of the ECCG, will issue guidance about the
acceptability of different types of assurance components for the different
EUCS assurance levels, including potential gaps and attention points.

[[sec_B.8.3]]
==== Assessing assurance related to individual requirements

The second step consists in verifying that the assurance documentation
available for the subservice provider is adequate to determine that
the subservice provider meets the expectations of the CSP relative
to individual EUCS requirements.

This assessment is performed for every subservice provider, and then
for every EUCS requirement for which the CSP has declared to rely
partially or fully on the assurance provided by the subservice provider,
by formulating an assumption on the subservice's control.

The auditor shall for each such assumption determine whether or not
the assurance provided in the available assurance documentation is
adequate. There are several ways to reach a conclusion that the assurance
is adequate:

* The required information is available with the expected assurance
level in the assurance documentation.

* The information available in the assurance documentation does not
cover the full scope of the requirement, but additional controls implemented
by the subservice provider or compensating controls implemented by
the CSP allow the auditor to determine that the information is adequate.

* The information available in the assurance documentation does not
offer the expected level of assurance, but the controls implemented
by the CSP to assess and monitor the subservice provider allow the
auditor to determine that the information is adequate.

Finally, if the assurance documentation mentions nonconformities on
the controls used to meet an assumption, the corrective measures proposed
and implemented by the subservice provider and reviewed by its auditor
shall be adequate to guarantee that the assumption is indeed met.

ENISA, with the support of the ECCG, will issue guidance about the
adequacy of different types of assurance components for the different
EUCS assurance levels, including acceptable additional and compensating
controls that may be implemented by the subservice providers and by
the CSP.

[[sec_B.8.4]]
==== EUCS-certified subservices

When a subservice has been certified in the EUCS scheme, the processes
defined above may be simplified:

* The auditor's competence and independence does not need to be assessed;

* The report can be considered as being fully compliant with the rules
of the EUCS scheme for the assurance level of the report;

* No mapping to the EUCS scheme's requirements is needed.

Finally, if the cloud service and its subservice satisfy the requirements
for composition, the assessment may be simplified further since the
information provided by the subservice organization has already been
assessed.

[[sec_B.9]]
=== ISSUING THE EVALUATION REPORT

After evaluating the adequacy of the assurance provided to support
assumptions about subservice providers, the auditor shall form a conclusion,
combine it with the conclusion from the assurance report, and issue
an evaluation report.

The conclusion shall include the audit's team recommendation as to
whether the assurance documentation is adequate or not to support
the certification of the CSP using these subservice providers. The
conclusion shall be based on the audit activities and express whether,
in all material respects,

. the audit documentation provided for every subservice provider is
adequate to provide assurance corresponding to the targeted EUCS assurance
level,

. for every assumption formulating by the CSP regarding a contribution
of a subservice provider to the conformity to an EUCS requirement,
the audit documentation provided for that subservice provider is adequate
to determine that the assumption formulated by the CSP is correct,
with the targeted EUCS assurance level, and

. for every nonconformity identified in assurance documentation regarding
a control used to determine that an assumption formulated by the CSP
is correct, appropriate corrective actions have been proposed, implemented
and validated by an auditor.

The auditor shall then combine this conclusion of the dependency analysis
with the conclusion from the assurance report, for a conclusion regarding
the fulfilment of relevant EUCS requirements by the cloud service,
and make a recommendation regarding the possible certification of
the cloud service under the conditions outlined in the CSP's application.

The auditor shall issue the evaluation report that satisfies the requirements
defined in <<annex_f>>.

This dependency report shall be first addressed to the CSP. The CSP
may contest the content of the assurance report and in particular
the audit team's recommendation. If the dispute remains unresolved,
the CSP may file a complaint with the NCCA to request their opinion
on the matter of the dispute.

The auditor then delivers the evaluation report, comprising at least
the assurance report and the present evaluation report, and if applicable,
additional assurance or evaluation reports of sub service providers,
to the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) accredited to issue EUCS certificates,
which will then proceed to a review and certification decision.

[[sec_B.10]]
=== REVIEW OF THE EVALUATION

Once an assurance report and an evaluation report (and, if required,
supporting reports) have been delivered by the auditor, the CAB shall
perform a review of all information and results related to the evaluation,
based on these reports:

* The review shall not be subcontracted;

* The review shall be carried out by one or more persons who have
not been involved in the audit phase, whom will be called collectively
the reviewer;

* The recommendations for a certification decision based on the review
shall be documented, unless the review and the certification decision
are completed concurrently by the same person;

* The persons carrying out the review shall not normally overturn
a negative recommendation of the audit team. If such a situation does
arise, the CAB shall document and justify the basis for the decision
to overturn the recommendation.

The review shall include at least the following activities:

* A review of the sufficiency of the information provided in the assurance
report and supporting documentation with respect to the EUCS requirements
and the certification scope;

* A review of the nonconformities identified in the assurance report
and related corrective actions

* A review of the issues identified in the evaluation report's dependency
analysis; and

* A recommendation for the certification decision, based on a documented
opinion on whether or not the requirements of the EUCS have been satisfied
by the CSP and by the auditor.

[[sec_B.10.1]]
==== Review of the sufficiency of the assurance report

The CAB shall review the assurance report and supporting documentation
concerning the following aspects:

===== General

The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications.
In case of a negative answer, the review shall provide an analysis
of the consequences of the negative answer:

* Does the report contain the required parts?

* Does the provided documentation include the required support documentation?

* Is the conformity assessment performed in due time?

===== Security controls and requirements

The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications.
In case of a negative answer, the review shall provide an analysis
of the consequences of the negative answer:

* If there is a mapping from a set of controls provided by the CSP
to the security controls and requirements defined in EUCS, is this
mapping adequate?

* For every control or requirement analysed during the audit, have
the appropriate activities been performed and documented?

===== Nonconformities

The CAB shall review the assurance report and supporting documentation
concerning the handling of nonconformities detected during the audit.

The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications.
In case of a negative answer, the review shall provide an analysis
of the consequences of the negative answer.

* For every major nonconformity identified during the audit, is adequate
information provided in the assurance report?

* For every minor nonconformity identified during the audit, is adequate
information provided in the assurance report?

* For every nonconformity identified during the audit, does the reviewer
accept the analysis provided by the auditor?

[[sec_B.10.2]]
==== Review of the evaluation report

===== Dependency analysis

The CAB shall review the dependency analysis and supporting documentation
concerning the adequacy of the assurance documentation available about
subservice providers.

The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications.
In case of a negative answer, the review shall provide an analysis
of the consequences of the negative answer:

* For every subservice provider mentioned in the assurance report,
is there adequate assurance documentation available?

* For every assumption in the assurance report about a subservice
provider, is the documentation available adequate to determine that
assumption correct?

===== Recommendation for the certification decision

The CAB shall review the recommendation for the certification decision
provided in the evaluation report and how it combined the conclusions
of the audit report with those of the dependency analysis.

The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications.
In case of a negative answer, the review shall provide an analysis
of the consequences of the negative answer:

* Is the certification decision proposed in the assurance report adequate
according to the provided documentation?

* In the case of a maintenance conformity assessment, does the proposed
certification decision include all the information required to maintain
the certificate, with proper justification?

* If the cloud service depends on subservice providers, is the assurance
documentation adequate or not to support the certification of the
CSP using these subservice providers?

[[sec_B.10.3]]
==== Review reporting

The results of the review shall be documented in a report, which shall
include all the answers to the question above, together with a justification.

If the conformity assessment results in the issuance or maintenance
of a certificate, this review report shall be included in the publicly
available certification or maintenance report.

[[sec_B.11]]
=== CERTIFICATION DECISION

The CAB shall assign at least one person to make the certification
decision based on all information related to the evaluation, its review,
and any other relevant information. The certification decision shall
be carried out by a person or group of persons that has not been involved
in the audit activities (but may have been involved in the review
process).

The certification decision shall not be subcontracted.

The CAB shall notify the CSP of a decision not to grant certification,
to withdraw a certificate, or to suspend a certificate, and shall
identify the reasons for the decision. The CSP may contest the CAB's
decision. If the dispute remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint
with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.

[[sec_B.12]]
=== CERTIFICATION

If the certification decision is negative, i.e. if the cloud service
has been determined not to meet the EUCS scheme's requirements, the
consequences are as follows:

* In the case of an initial conformity assessment, no further action
is required, i.e. no certificate shall be issued;

* In the case of a maintenance conformity assessment, the certificate
shall be suspended by appending the maintenance report as rationale
for the suspension, and then the process for handling nonconformities
shall be followed.

If the certification decision is positive, i.e. if the cloud service
has been determined not to meet the EUCS scheme's requirements, the
consequences are as follows, depending of the nature of the assessment.

* In the case of an initial assessment, the CAB shall issue a new
certificate, including the full certification report, and set the
expiration date three (3) years after the date of issuance, unless
the CAB has explicitly indicated a shorter validity period for the
certificate;

* In the case of a periodic assessment, the CAB shall update the existing
certificate by appending the maintenance report, and if needed by
updating elements in the certificate that have changed;

* In the case of a renewal assessment, the CAB shall update the existing
certificate by appending the maintenance report, by setting the expiration
date of the certificate three (3) years after the date of this update,
and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed;

* In the case of a restoration assessment, the CAB shall update the
existing certificate by appending the maintenance report, and if needed
by updating elements in the certificate that have changed, and shall
return the certificate's status to "certified";

* In the case of a restoration assessment, the CAB shall update the
existing certificate by appending the maintenance report, and if needed
by updating elements in the certificate that have changed;

The reports mentioned in the paragraph above are specified in <<annex_f>>.
