== MARKS AND LABELS

.ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE
____
*Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include
at least the following elements:*

(i) where the scheme provides for marks or labels, the conditions
under which such marks or labels may be used;
____

The European Cybersecurity Certification Framework may provide for
a label and associated mark.

When available, such a label shall be specifically implemented for
this scheme, in order to allow its application on each certificate,
certified cloud service and related documentation. The labels used
on the cloud service and related documentation shall contain exactly
the same information as the label included on the certificate, and
follow all the guidelines provided with the label and associated mark
defined for the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework.

A label and associated mark shall only be used when the certificate
is awarded and until its expiration, and in association with the certified
cloud service: the non-respect of this condition shall be considered
as an irregularity, as defined by <<sec_11>>.

Without prejudice to the rules for monitoring compliance as described
under <<sec_11>>, depending on the circumstances, the nature and impact
of the non-respect, wrong use, misuse, abuse of the mark and or label
may have other legal implications in the field of IP right protection,
possible criminal allegations (e.g. fraud, deceit), market surveillance
regulations related to consumer protection (e.g. misleading and or
unlawful comparative advertising of cloud services). These legal implications
are outside the scope of this EUCS scheme.

=== RATIONALE

A label and associated mark, established for the European Cybersecurity
Certification Framework and specifically implemented for this scheme,
will allow to:

* highlight that the cloud service has been certified in the European
Union and to provide immediate information regarding the certificate
by referring to the framework (ECCF), the evaluation scheme and the
assurance level;

* make the certification easily recognizable as both the label and
the associated mark may be used in the cloud service's web site and
printed on technical documents and on leaflets used for marketing
purposes;

* provide a direct link (in the form of a QR code) to the ENISA website
(as per Article 50) - where all the information regarding the certificate
are disclosed, including the current status of the certificate.

The "demo label", shows the basic information that the label associated
with the scheme may contain:

* logo of the ECCF (to be registered, regulated and protected by the
entity in charge of the enforcement of the labelling framework);

* logo of the EUCS (to be registered, regulated and protected by the
entity in charge of the enforcement of the labelling framework);

* QR code pointing to the web portal of ENISA - as per the Article
50 of the CSA &#8211; and to the page where the effective status of
the certificate of the cloud service and the information regarding
its lifecycle can be retrieved;

* CSA assurance level (with the introduction of a specific colour
identifying each level);

* specific EUCS assurance level;

* the sentence "Certified in the European Union", together with the
flag of the EU.

The introduction of the QR code will imply, as defined by <<sec_20>>,
a procedure for the release of the QR code.

The demo label only contains summary information. In particular, it
does not contain any reference to a date or to an issuing CAB. The
use of the label therefore needs to be be strictly controlled to ensure
that:

* The label is only used in direct relationship with a certified cloud
service;

* The label is only used when the corresponding certificate is valid
(i.e. after issuance, before withdrawal or expiration);

* The assurance levels and logos mentioned on the label are the appropriate
ones for the particular cloud service; and

* The label is only used with the QR-code obtained through the procedure
defined in <<sec_20>>, which points to ENISA's Web site.

Compliance monitoring is in charge of ensuring that CSPs comply to
these requirements.
